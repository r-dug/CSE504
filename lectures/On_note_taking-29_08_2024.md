## 29_08_2024

Unlike most classes at UofL, Automata Theory is administered entirely in person.

It is the end of week two at the time of writing and up to this point I have only been taking hand written notes.

going forward, I will continue to take hand written notes but will also use this file to take notes.

Because of the abstract mathematics this class focuses on, I will make an effort to take notes in LAtEX.
